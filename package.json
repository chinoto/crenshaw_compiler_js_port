I wanted to compile (or [transpile][Transpiler] rather?) programs to [Expression 2] (pretty much for the hell of it), and I've always thought [LLVM] was rather interesting, so I decided I would try building a backend for it. But before I could even contemplate doing that, I thought it would be good to learn how to build a basic compiler first so I cover all the basic knowledge (even if I don't need it, it's good to understand things).",
